# News-Analysis-Project
This project helps us understand news articles better by doing 3 things: 1. Clean Up Articles: We'll remove unnecessary clutter like punctuation and common words to focus on the main ideas. 2. Check the Mood: We'll build a system to figure out if an article is happy, sad, or neutral about a topic. 3. Find Connections
